A. Visually compare annual salamander counts in old growth (OG) and clear cut (CC) sections of Mack Creek...

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mack_creek_dite <- mack_creek_vert %>% 
  filter(species %in% "DITE") %>% 
  count(year, section)

mack_creek_dite_table <- mack_creek_dite %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = section, values_from = n)
```

***Figure 3: Annual Salamander Counts in Old Growth (OG) & Clear Cut (CC) Forests along Mack Creek.*** *Counts of Pacific Giant Salamander in clear cut forest and old growth forest sections along Mack Creek are shown from 1993 through 2017. Data [Gregory S.V. 2016](https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/5de64af9c11579266ef20da2ff32f702]*

Observations of Pacific Giant Salamander's along Mack Creek are compared between the old growth sections and clear cut sections between the years of 1993 and 2017. As shown in Figure 3, the overall graph shapes and counts are very similar between the two different sections between the years. General trends along both graphs show that there was an increase in observation counts during the year 2002. There was a decrease in counts during 2014 and then the counts then increased again after that. These trends are consistent across both creek sections, indicating that there may not be a difference in Pacific Giant Salamander's ability to survive in the two different habitat types.

       caption = "1993 - 2017",

```

B. Table of 2017 salamander counts by channel classification (pool, cascades and side-channel) in old growth (OG) and clear cut (CC) sections of Mack Creek...

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#Get the counts....
mack_creek_counts <- mack_creek_vert %>% 
  filter(unittype %in% c("P", "C", "SC")) %>% 
  filter(species %in% "DITE") %>% 
  filter(year == "2017") %>% 
  filter(section %in% c("CC", "OG")) %>% 
  count(unittype, species, year, section) %>% 
  group_by(unittype, section) %>% 
  summarize(counts = sum(n)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = unittype, values_from = counts) %>% 

  rename("Pool" = P,
         "Cascades" = C,
         "Side Channel" = SC,
         "Section" = section)



  
  




```
 

***Table 1: 2017 Pacific Giant Salamander Counts by Channel Classification in Mack Creek*** *Pacific Giant Salamander counts along clear cut and old growth forest sections of Mack Creek. Mack Creek is further separated by channel classifications into cascades, pool, and side channel. The most Pacific Giant Salamander counts were made along the cascades channel classification of Mack Creek for both the clear cut and old growth sections. The least Pacific Giant Salamander counts were made along the pool channel classifications of Mack Creek.*
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
mack_creek_props <- mack_creek_counts %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>% 
  adorn_ns(position = "front")

mack_creek_props$Section <- gsub("CC", "Clear Cut", mack_creek_props$Section)
mack_creek_props$Section <- gsub("OG", "Old Growth", mack_creek_props$Section)


kable(mack_creek_props) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", 
                full_width = F,
                position = "center") %>% 
  row_spec(c(1:2),
                   color = "navy")



```


C.  Is there a significant difference in where in the channel Pacific giant salamanders are located (pool, cascade or side channel) between the two sections (old growth and clear cut)? 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
chi_test_location <- mack_creek_counts %>% 
  select(-Section)

```


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
chi_test_channel <- chisq.test(chi_test_location)

```
Using the 2017 Pacific Giant Salamander counts in clear cut sections (Cascades: `r mack_creek_props$Cascades[1]`, Pool: `r mack_creek_props$Pool[1]`, Side Channel: `r mack_creek_props$"Side Channel"[1]`) and old growth sections (Cascades: `r mack_creek_props$Cascades[2]`, Pool: `r mack_creek_props$Pool[2]`, Side Channel: `r mack_creek_props$"Side Channel"[2]`) in Mack Creek, there is no association (`r chi_test_channel[["p.value"]]`) between Pacific Giant Salamander counts in clear cut and old growth sections. In other words, there is not a significant effect of forest condition on where in the channel Pacific Giant Salamanders are found.


H0: Is there a significant difference in where pacific giant salamanders are located between the two sections? 

HA: There is no significant difference....



D. Compare weights of Pacific giant salamanders in clear cut and old growth forest sections of the creek in 2017

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
section_mack_creek_weight <- mack_creek_vert %>% 
  select(year, species, section, weight) %>% 
  filter(year %in% "2017",
         species %in% "DITE",
         section %in% c("CC", "OG")) %>% 
  group_by(section) %>% 
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sample_size = n())





section_mack_creek_weight$section <- gsub("OG", "Old growth", section_mack_creek_weight$section)
section_mack_creek_weight$section <- gsub("CC", "Clear cut", section_mack_creek_weight$section) 

kable(section_mack_creek_weight) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", 
                full_width = F,
                position = "center") %>% 
  row_spec(c(1:2),
                   color = "purple")



```

Is there a significant difference in mean weights for Pacific giant salamanders observed in the two forest sections (clear cut and old growth) in 2017? 
 
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
weight_2017 <- mack_creek_vert %>% 
  select(c("section", "year", "species", "weight")) %>% 
  filter(section %in% c("CC", "OG"),
         year %in% "2017",
         species %in% "DITE")
```
 
 
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
weight_og <- weight_2017 %>% 
  filter(section =="OG",
         year %in% "2017") %>% 
  pull(weight)

weight_cc <- weight_2017 %>% 
  filter(section == "CC",
         year %in% "2017") %>% 
  pull(weight)

weight_ttest <- t.test(weight_cc, weight_og)

weight_d <- effsize::cohen.d(weight_cc, weight_og, na.rm = TRUE)

```

There is NO significant difference in mean weights for Pacific Giant Salamanders between the two forest sections (clear cut & old growth) in 2017. The mean salamander weights for clear cut, `r round(weight_ttest[["estimate"]][1], 2)` grams, and old growth, `r round(weight_ttest[["estimate"]][2], 2)` grams, forest sections do not differ significantly (two-sided t-test, t(`r round(weight_ttest[["parameter"]][1], 0)`) = `r round(weight_ttest[["statistic"]][1], 2)` *p* = `r round(weight_ttest[["p.value"]][1], 3)`) and the effect size is small (Cohen's D = `r round(weight_d[["estimate"]], 2)`). This indicates that between the two forest sections, mean Pacific Giant Salamander weight differences are not significant nor substantive.



E. Compare weights of Pacific giant salamanders in pools, cascades and side-channels of Mack Creek in 2017...

First,
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
mack_creek_weight_unit <- mack_creek_vert %>% 
  filter(year == "2017",
         species == "DITE",
         unittype %in% c("C", "P", "SC")) %>% 
  group_by(unittype)

summary_mack_creek_weight_unit <- mack_creek_weight_unit %>% 
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sample_size = n(),
            se_weight = sd((weight) / sqrt(n()), (na.rm = TRUE)),
            var_weight = var(weight, na.rm = TRUE))



table_summary <- summary_mack_creek_weight_unit
table_summary$unittype[table_summary$unittype == "C"] <- "Cascade"
table_summary$unittype[table_summary$unittype == "P"] <- "Pool"
table_summary$unittype[table_summary$unittype == "SC"] <- "Side Channel"

kable(table_summary) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", 
                full_width = F,
                position = "center") %>% 
  row_spec(c(1:3),
                   color = "purple")


```






```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = summary_mack_creek_weight_unit, aes(x = unittype, y = mean_weight)) +
  geom_beeswarm(data = mack_creek_weight_unit,
                aes(x = unittype,
                    y = weight,
                    color = unittype
                    ),
                show.legend = FALSE,
                size = 1.4,
                alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_errorbar(data = summary_mack_creek_weight_unit, aes(ymin = mean_weight - sd_weight, ymax = mean_weight + sd_weight),
                width = 0.2, color = "firebrick") +
  geom_point(data = summary_mack_creek_weight_unit, aes(x = unittype, y = mean_weight)) +
  labs(x = "Unit Type",
       y = "Weight (grams)",
       title = "Pacific Giant Salamander Weights between the Three Channels",
       caption = "Weight comparison for 2017") +
 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Pool", "Cascades", "Side-channel")) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  theme_dark() 
```



Second, Is there a significant difference in mean weights for Pacific giant salamanders observed in pools vs. cascades vs. side-channels in 2017?
```{r}
weight_aov <- aov(weight ~ unittype, data = mack_creek_weight_unit) 
  summary(mack_creek_weight_unit)
  
lm_weight <- lm(weight ~unittype, data = mack_creek_weight_unit)
weight_aov_3 <- Anova(lm_weight)

```

- There is no significant variance across the three observed unittypes. Hence, we retain the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in mean weights for Pacific Giant Salamanders. The F statistic`r weight_aov_3$"Pr(>F)"` 



Third, describe any concerns you have about comparing means across the groups. What might be another option to consider moving forward with the analysis?

```{r}
TukeyHSD(weight_aov)
```


one way ANOVA with post-hoc TUKEy's HSD reveals significant difference in mean flipper length across all species (Gentoo, mean = , Chinstrap, mean = ......, Adelie, mean = .......) (F(df) = ...., p < 0.001 for all pairwise comparisons)
